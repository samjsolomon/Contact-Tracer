## Purpose

This program is designed for a Rollins College COVID-19 administrator to manage virus transmissions through contact tracing. A student can be given a symptoms questionnaire and a contacts questionnaire to track their immediate contacts within the past 7 days. An administrator can track the status of students, provide official health recommendations to students based on their test results, and view campus dashboard statistics.. If a student tests positive for COVID-19, it is important to appropriately isolate them for 14 days. If a student was in close contact with a positive COVID-19 case, it is important to ensure that that student gets tested for COVID-19 to ensure a controlled  environment.
